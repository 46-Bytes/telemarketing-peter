## Getting Started(React + TypeScript + Vite)

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled.

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a production build in the `dist` directory.

4. **Preview Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This will preview the production build locally.

5. **Run Linting**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   This will check your code for any linting issues.

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
